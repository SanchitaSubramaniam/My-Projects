                <h2>I am most interested in space, and therefore I watch videos related to space on YouTube. I first got my interest in this when I first heard about the Big Bang theory that could have created the Universe. I got pulled into this topic when I responded to its name, and said "Big Bang? That sounds weird! Let me take a closer look at this". Ever since then, I was ALL about space. I was fascinated that the large and vast Universe could have been created from this explosion! I have also gotten interested in planets like Mars. I also admire an astronaut named Alyssa Carson, since she is going to be the first person to land on Mars. And ever since then, I have been very interested in space travel, and I have considered being an astronaut when I grow up, but decided that I wanted to be a space scientist (astrononomer) when I grow up.</h2>
