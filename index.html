           During my free time, I like watching videos on YouTube, specifically space and VR videos. I am very interested in space, so I use my free time to watch videos about it. The info I learn while watching the videos are useful in my Science class at school, and they blow minds of my friends as well! Watching these videos make me more confident, especially in Science and Math class, and it is very useful. It lightens up my mood when I have a bad day. Learning about this helps to address basic questions about our place in the Universe and the history of our solar system. I am fasicnated by all of this and formed an idea of what I want to be when I grow up: a scientist!
